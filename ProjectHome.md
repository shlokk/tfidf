This library implements tf-idf as described by  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf

The library constructs an IDF corpus and stopword list either from documents specified by the client, or by reading from input files.  It computes IDF for a specified term based on the corpus, or generates keywords ordered by tf-idf for a specified document.
